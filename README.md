# Knowledge-Trees

I try to write about the important things I learn. I used to do this by creating an empty folder in my desktop and populating it with word documents. Each word document would be related to a broad topic, such as History, and within that word document I would write everything I learned about the subject.

This works alright, but it can get unnecessarily burdensome to continually format, organize, and search through the documents.

To that extent, I created a simple Windows desktop application that would help me better better organize my writings. 

The goal of this application is to help the user create and navigate through his Trees (each representing a distinct subject) and within those Trees, all of the user's entries on the subject (Leaves).

## Download and Installation
Please note that this is a Winforms application, and it only works on Windows desktop. You also need to have Microsoft Office installed.
